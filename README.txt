1. DESCRIPTION

    aim of the game is to protect the Citadel from the impending swarm of Robots, and
    reach a high score before the Citadel has been breached.

2. WHAT TO EXPECT

    The application is 'GUI-based'. The User is able to interact with the GUI via the 
    Arena, containing the Grid and the Citadel located at the center.
        
    The game begins as soon as the program is ran.

    The User can click on a cell in the Arena, if unoccupied, and queue a command to 
    place a Wall. The Wall can sustain two hits by a Robot. 

    Note: It is intended to only have 10 Walls present at a given time, however,
    this feature is still to be implemented.
